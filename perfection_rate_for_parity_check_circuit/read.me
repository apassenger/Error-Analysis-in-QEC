In this folder, the code for finding the perfection rate for the entire parity check circuit exists.

To use the code with your own data, you should first run the first part of the code and extract the errors for each individual gate. 

Then, you should provide the output of the first code as a 'dict' parameter to this code

As an output of this code, you will receive the perfection rate of the widget and the total accumulated error rate in the circuit
